# tiny_core_graphics_library
This was a project from my Operating Systems class at the University of Pittsburgh. It implements a basic graphics driver for Tiny Core Linux running on Qemu-Arm. Here we had to implement functions that modified the framebuffer using systemcalls only. No stdlib functions were allowed. This is fully functional and could handle any driver you wrote for it.
